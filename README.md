# [The Red Lobster Book](https://example.com)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything
I know about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/benkyonodo/redbook).

This wiki is inspired and cloned from the [The blue book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book).
**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lyz-code.github.io/redbook).**

## Installation
You can build the docs with

    mkdocs build 

HTML Files will be copied to the site/-Directory.

## Publish on github
You can publish the site on github-pages.

    mkdocs gh-deploy



## Thank you
